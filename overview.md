In this resource you will use a micro:bit to help (or sabotage!) Steve in Minecraft by connecting the pins on your micro:bit to the General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins on a Raspberry Pi using some cables and crocodile clips. Then, using Python, write programs to detect motion from the micro:bits accerometor and will make Steve shake in Minecraft!
