# Micromine Bitcraft

![](cover_learn.png)

You can use your micro:bit with some Python code to help (or sabotage!) Steve in Minecraft.
You are going to connect your micro:bitâ€™s pins to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins using some cables and crocodile clips; programs on the micro:bit and Raspberry Pi will make Steve shake in Minecraft when the micro:bit is shaken, and will make blocks disappear when button A is pressed.
