## What you will make
In this resource, you will use a micro:bit to help (or sabotage!) Steve in Minecraft by connecting the pins on your micro:bit to the General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins on a Raspberry Pi using some cables and crocodile clips. Then, using Python, you will write programs to detect motion from the micro:bit's accelerometer and make Steve shake in Minecraft!


## What you will learn
By using your micro:bit to shake Steve in Minecraft Pi you will learn:

- How to connect a micro:bit to a Raspberry Pi
- How to program the micro:bit and Minecraft using Python
- How to connect and program the buttons and pins on the micro:bit and Raspberry Pi to detect motion

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)
- [Use basic digital, analogue, and electromechanical components](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/creator)
